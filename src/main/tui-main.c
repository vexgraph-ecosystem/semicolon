;;DEFINITION
/** The semicolon IDE shell: the design from src/tui/tui_example.txt, drawing a
 * real file on a real terminal, with the rail draggable and the editor scrolling.
 *
 * This file is the HOST, not the toolkit. Determinant owns cells, placement,
 * panels, text and the mouse byte grammar and knows nothing about a tty;
 * acquiring the terminal, owning the alternate screen, deciding which mouse
 * events exist, reading a file and driving the whole thing are this program's
 * job. That is why ncurses is named only here.
 *
 * Two things are worth reading this file for.
 *
 * First, SCROLLING IS FREE BECAUSE TEXT IS ADDRESSABLE. The editor's rows are
 * created once and then re-pointed at different lines each frame with
 * TerminalText_setText. No row is allocated, freed or rebuilt while scrolling,
 * which is the entire argument for a text being an object rather than a string
 * handed to a draw call.
 *
 * Second, THE DIVIDER IS DRAGGED BY MOVING AN ANCHOR. The rail's width is not
 * rebuilt into the tree when the pointer moves; the same layer gets a new
 * extent through TerminalPanel_setAnchor, and the next paint lays out around it.
 * Resizing a pane and scrolling a file are therefore both ordinary state changes,
 * not scene surgery.
 *
 * Nothing is transparent-by-accident: no panel sets a background, so every cell
 * the app does not paint keeps the terminal's own background. That is deliberate
 * — the theme belongs to whoever owns the terminal.
 *
 * The project rail is read from the filesystem, and every visible editor tab
 * owns a real file buffer with its own UTF-8 caret. Selecting a tab restores that
 * buffer; clicking source places the caret. Tabs close from their Nerd-font X or
 * middle-click. Markdown files have a rendered terminal preview and a source
 * toggle. Code view edits UTF-8 rows and attempts a staged save one second after
 * the last edit; a failure keeps the dirty buffer resident. Every mutation is a
 * bounded snapshot transaction: Ctrl-Z restores the pre-edit document, Ctrl-Y
 * reapplies it, and a refused edit leaves both the text and the redo path intact.
 * The console is a
 * separate centre-panel presentation, not source text: a fixed ring keeps the
 * last 10,000 bounded lines, and a finished child leaves a scrollable snapshot
 * until its tab closes. The rail and file buffers outlive that snapshot.
 *
 * C23 code coloring consumes Language through SemicolonSyntax: a copied complete
 * document snapshot is refreshed cold after edits, not during scrolling or cell
 * paint. It changes cell ink/weight only, never source bytes, caret coordinates,
 * glyphs or saved text. .c/.h explicitly select the initial C23-only host mode;
 * identifiers are classified by Language's conservative C23Highlights pass, with
 * no diagnostic or hint integration yet. */
;;OVERVIEW
/** ============================================================================
 * MODULE: semicolon terminal entry (src/main/tui-main.c)
 * ============================================================================
 * OWNED STATE (file-local):
 *   gQuit         signal-safe shutdown request only.
 *   gCells/gStyles/gFg/gBg          static canvas planes, TUI_MAX_W x TUI_MAX_H.
 *   gFrontCells/...                 static last-paint mirror for the surface diff.
 *   gRule/gSpaces/emptyLine         static textures: separators and blank runs.
 *   gGutter[TUI_MAX_ROWS][16]       per-row line-number text buffers.
 *   gLineChip[16]                   the status bar's line-position text buffer.
 *   gSaveLabel[16]                  saved/dirty/error status text.
 *   gPairs[]                        registered ncurses colour pairs.
 *   gRailLocation[PATH_MAX + 2] — canonical project location, HOME abbreviated
 *     only on a complete path-component match; painted gray beside the pinned root.
 *   gConsoleLines[10000][2048], gConsoleLengths[10000] — bounded line ring;
 *     head/count/top/follow track retained and viewed output independently of
 *     editor scroll, omitted/clipped counts make both limits observable.
 *   gRunPid/gRunOutputFd — supervised child and nonblocking pipe; a finished
 *     child may still have pipe bytes to drain before the console is retired.
 *   gRunStatus/gRunOutcome — bounded, retained waitpid result for the tab and
 *     console heading; an unavailable result is never called exit zero.
 * STRUCT FIELDS:
 *   FileText (the open document, one heap-owned NUL-terminated row per line):
 *     char **lineStorage — owned editable UTF-8 rows.
 *     size_t length — serialized byte count including line endings.
 *     const char **lines — borrowed aliases to rows for rendering and Markdown.
 *     size_t *lineLengths — UTF-8 bytes excluding line endings.
 *     size_t *lineCapacities — allocated bytes per row including NUL.
 *     uint8_t *lineEndings — NONE/LF/CRLF serialization marker per row.
 *     size_t lineCount, lineCapacity — live rows and growable directory capacity.
 *     size_t longestCells, longestLine — horizontal extent and its row index.
 *     size_t cursorLine, cursorByte — caret position; byte offset is a scalar boundary.
 *     bool cursorVisible — paint the reverse-style caret after keyboard interaction.
 *     uint64_t lastEditNs — monotonic time of last document mutation.
 *     bool dirty, saveFailed, baselineValid — pending, refused and identity states.
 *     struct stat baseline — original file identity/size/mtime for conflict detection.
 *     char name[64] — breadcrumb display basename.
 *     SemicolonSyntax *syntax — owned copied C23 analysis, travels with the tab.
 *     bool syntaxPending, syntaxCurrent — refresh requested / matches live bytes.
 *     FileHistory history — bounded snapshot undo/redo, owned with this buffer.
 *   FileSnapshot (one owned document state): char **lineStorage, const char **lines,
 *     size_t *lineLengths, *lineCapacities, uint8_t *lineEndings — full owned row
 *     copies; size_t lineCount/lineCapacity — exact snapshot geometry; size_t
 *     cursorLine/cursorByte — restored caret; uint64_t revision — document identity;
 *     bool valid — capture completed (a refused capture owns nothing).
 *   FileSnapshotStack: FileSnapshot *items, size_t count/capacity — growable stack,
 *     capped at TUI_HISTORY_LIMIT with the oldest entry dropped.
 *   FileHistory: FileSnapshotStack undo/redo — committed past and future states;
 *     FileSnapshot pending; bool pendingValid — the pre-edit capture awaiting commit
 *     or cancellation; uint64_t currentRevision/nextRevision/savedRevision — dirty
 *     identity, so undo after save knows the text differs from disk.
 *   TuiRow:
 *     TerminalText *gutter — line number object.
 *     TerminalText *code — source text object.
 *   Scene:
 *     TerminalPanel *root, *header, *rail — retained component tree.
 *     TerminalPanel *editor — borrowed child of centre, for live gutter geometry.
 *     TerminalPanel *codeActions — borrowed code overlay; repainted after ink projection.
 *     TerminalChildId railId, gutterId, editorId — child identities in their
 *       owning panels; editorId collapses while the console owns the centre.
 *     bool editorPanelVisible — last admitted editor anchor mode, changed only
 *       when switching between file and console tabs.
 *     size_t modeWidth — top-row mode band.
 *     TuiRow rows[TUI_MAX_ROWS]; size_t rowCount — fixed visible code-row objects.
 *     TerminalText *lineChip, *saveChip — footer viewport and save-state labels.
 *     size_t railWidth, numberWidth — current layout geometry; initial rail width is
 *       TUI_RAIL_DEFAULT_WIDTH (50 cells).
 *     TerminalText *railRows[TUI_MAX_ROWS]; size_t railRowCount — visible rail rows.
 *     char railText[TUI_MAX_ROWS][TUI_RAIL_TEXT] — storage borrowed by those rows.
 *     TerminalText *breadcrumb, *activeTab — current file identity labels.
 *     TerminalText *languageHints, *runHint — code-mode action hints.
 *     TerminalText *runTab; TerminalChildId runTabId; char runTabText[160],
 *       runTabShown[160] —
 *       persistent backing and closeable header view for the captured child console.
 *     TerminalText *codeMode, *previewMode — icon-and-label Markdown mode controls.
 *     TerminalMarkdownView *markdown — borrowed-source renderer instance.
 *     bool markdownFile, preview — file kind and active presentation mode.
 *     size_t codeModeWidth, previewModeWidth, markdownModeGap — control geometry.
 *     TerminalMarkdownCodeBlock hoverBlock — shaded block under the pointer.
 *     bool hoverCopy — pointer rests on that block's Copy chip.
 *     char markdownNotice[48]; uint64_t markdownNoticeUntilNs — transient copy notice.
 *   RailEntry slot record: char label[TUI_RAIL_TEXT] (tree-borrowed name);
 *     char path[1024] (opened path); TerminalTreeNodeId parent (tree parent);
 *     bool loaded (children were read once); bool folder (directory classification).
 *   Interaction: TerminalInput input (mouse decoder); bool grabbing, tracking,
 *     pressed, havePointer (gesture state); size_t trackX, trackLeft, grabX,
 *     grabWidth, pointerX, pointerY (gesture origin and last pointer cell).
 *   Scroll motion: borrowed from Determinant's TerminalScrollGlide
 *     (terminal/terminal_scroll_glide.h); this host owns the file bounds.
 *   DirEntry slot record: char name[TUI_RAIL_TEXT] (sorted entry name);
 *     bool folder (directory classification).
 *   ScrollStep slot record: bool keyed (recognized navigation key);
 *     int rows, columns (viewport delta).
 *   IgnorePattern SLOT RECORD: char *text (owned glob without leading slash or
 *     trailing directory slash); bool negated (last-match re-inclusion); bool
 *     directoryOnly (rule was written with a trailing slash).
 *   Ignore-pattern registry: IgnorePattern *gIgnorePatterns, size_t
 *     gIgnorePatternCount, gIgnorePatternCapacity (growable parsed root rules);
 *     struct timespec gIgnoreModified, bool gIgnoreStatValid, bool gIgnoreFromOpen
 *     (disk revision and current source); char gIgnorePath[1024], uint64_t
 *     gOpenIgnoreHash (source identity and live-buffer revision hash).
 * EditorTab SLOT RECORD:
 *   char path[1024] — opened file identity.
 *   char label[128], display[160], shown[160] — name, Nerd-X label, clipped label.
 *   FileText suspended — owned buffer while this tab is inactive; active buffer is
 *     held at the stable runTerminal FileText address.
 *   size_t x, width — last admitted chrome-row hit rectangle in terminal cells.
 *   bool preview — that tab's Markdown mode.
 *   TerminalText *view; TerminalChildId child — borrowed chrome child identity.
 *   bool gCachedRailCustom, gRailWidthCustomized — only a width chosen by dragging
 *     overrides the 40-cell default; legacy cached defaults are ignored.
 * ICON SETTINGS:
 *    bool gNerdIcons = true — current user setting, overridden by environment/CLI.
 *   EditorTab *gTabs, gTabCount, gTabCapacity — growable open-file tab stack.
 *   gTabFirst / gTabReveal — whole-tab viewport and one-shot selected-tab reveal;
 *     hidden tabs have zero geometry, clipped labels retain their close control.
 *   gRailColumn / gRailMaxColumn — bounded horizontal child-list viewport;
 *     the pinned project/location header never pans with child rows.
 *   size_t gActiveTabIndex — active tab identity in that stack.
 *   static const char *fileIcon(const char *name) — exact build names, then folded
 *     extensions, then generic file; borrowed static UTF-8, no IO or allocation.
 *   static bool setIconMode(const char *mode) — admit nerd/plain or THROW and retain
 *     the previous setting. Environment is read first; explicit CLI overrides it.
 *   static uint32_t iconColor(uint32_t glyph) — fixed palette for icon glyphs only;
 *     names do not inherit it.
 *   static size_t railIndent(TerminalTreeRow, size_t) — shared indent geometry.
 *   static void paintRailColors(Scene *, TerminalCanvas *, ...) — paint icon palette
 *     and orange foreground for root-.gitignore matches after layout. The root
 *     stays on row zero beside its clipped gray location while children scroll;
 *     body row y maps to tree scrollRow + y, independent of editor/tab geometry. 
 *     Child indentation advances two spaces per level (six levels maximum).
 *   static bool visibleDotEntry(name, folder) — admits only .github, .gitignore,
 *     and .gitkeep; other dot entries stay hidden.
 *   static bool ignorePatternAdd(line) / void ignorePatternsClear/Reload(void)
 *     parse root .gitignore text, preferring its active editor buffer; disk changes
 *     are detected by mtime.
 *   static bool ignorePatternMatches(pattern, relative) / railEntryIgnored(entry)  
 *     apply ordered component globs, negation, and directory rules to visible rows;
 *     this never consults Git status
 *   Folder open/closed icons are selected from the visible row's expansion state;
 *   plain mode uses [] folders and - files. No automatic font detection is claimed.
 *   Tree labels stay white under the pointer unless root-.gitignore matches them;
 *     matching visible names are orange, while selection background stays.

 *   static void frameBracket(void *, TerminalPresentPhase)  the frame transaction
 *   static int runInputProbe(void)   DEBUG: print what the terminal sends
 *   static int runBackgroundProbe(void)   DEBUG: what is this terminal's background?
 *   static int runTerminal(FileText *)
 * Entry:
 *   int main(int, char **)   --help / --dump [WxH] / --file PATH / interactive.
 * Contracts:
 *   The interactive path REQUIRES a tty on stdin and stdout and refuses before
 *   ncurses otherwise. It selects the environment's LC_CTYPE before newterm and
 *   sends canvas cells through ncurses' wide-character API. Raw mode keeps Ctrl-Z
 *   available to the editor as byte 26, so Ctrl-C is read explicitly as byte 3;
 *   a real SIGINT/SIGTERM still requests the same ordinary save-then-exit. Ctrl-C
 *   is the ONLY quit key - a letter key must not quit,
 *   because the terminal is a text editor and letters are text; the terminal is
 *   restored on every normal exit and on SIGINT/SIGTERM (SIGKILL or a crash
 *   cannot promise that).
 *   Mouse reporting is enabled for ANY-MOTION plus SGR encoding, so hover and
 *   drag both arrive; it is disabled again on exit, which hands the mouse back to
 *   the terminal's own selection. Wheel scrolls three lines, a pointer resting on
 *   the top or bottom editor row scrolls one line per motion event, and a press
 *   within one cell of the divider begins a drag that resizes the rail. Code view
 *   inserts printable UTF-8 bytes, splits/joins/deletes lines and autosaves after one
 *   idle second; Markdown preview is read-only. Save conflicts preserve the open buffer.
 *   No network is touched; a program is executed only after an explicit Run
 *   click. Workspace C test files use the project's registered b graph; other
 *   supported files use standalone b, which cannot infer their dependencies.
 *   A `.md` or
 *   `.markdown` file starts in read-only Markdown preview; the top-right
 *   `[preview]`/`[code]` controls switch presentation, and vertical scroll keys
 *   and wheel move the wrapped preview rows. Opening another file updates the
 *   controls and source borrow without rebuilding the scene.
 *   Colour carries REAL alpha: a translucent pen is composited over its cell's
 *   background, and that in turn over the device background, before the device is
 *   handed anything - a terminal has no alpha channel, so this is the only place a
 *   fade can happen. The device background is resolved at startup and is what a
 *   fade actually fades toward; fully opaque artwork passes through untouched.
